# üìö Library Management System -Java



A Library Management System made using the concepts of Object Oriented Analysis and Design. The interface is console based. 


## Actors:
The actors include the following: 
* Librarian
* Checkout Clerk
* Borrower
* Administrator

## Use Cases:
After determining the actors, the second step in use case analysis is to determine the tasks that each actor will need to do with the system. Each task is called a use case because it represents one particular way the system will be used.

**In other words, only those use cases are listed that actors will need to do when they are using the system to solve the customer‚Äôs problem.** 

### Borrower:
* ‚ùè Search for items by title.
* ‚ùè ... by author.
* ‚ùè ... by subject.
* ‚ùè Place a book on hold if it is on loan to somebody else.
* ‚ùè Check  the  borrower‚Äôs  personal  information  and  list  of  books  currently
borrowed.

### Checkout Clerk:
* ‚ùè All the Borrower use cases, plus
* ‚ùè Check out an item for a borrower.
* ‚ùè Check in an item that has been returned.
* ‚ùè Renew an item.
* ‚ùè Record that a fine has been paid.
* ‚ùè Add a new borrower.
* ‚ùè Update a borrower‚Äôs personal information (address, telephone number etc.).

### Librarian:
* ‚ùè All of the Borrower and Checkout Clerk use cases, plus
* ‚ùè Add a new item to the collection.
* ‚ùè Delete an item from the collection.
* ‚ùè Change the information the system has recorded about an item.

### Administrator:
* ‚ùè Add Clerk.
* ‚ùè Add Librarian.
