Use Cases:
After determining the actors, the second step in use case analysis is to determine the tasks that each actor will need to do with the system. Each task is called a use case because it represents one particular way the system will be used.

In other words, only those use cases are listed that actors will need to do when they are using the system to solve the customer’s problem.
